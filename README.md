# emacs_configs

Contains emacs configurations I use to extend emacs behaviour. It adds e.g. a duplicate line command C-c d. Another important addition is the build automation script for C programs. I configured F3 to compile the current buffer, show the compile result in another buffer and run the output C program in another shell buffer. This is important for the learning process because immediate feedback is essential.
